# Data Engineering Zoomcamp Homework

Welcome to my **Data Engineering Zoomcamp Homework Repository**! This repository contains all the homework assignments and solutions I‚Äôve completed as part of the [Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://datatalks.club/courses/engineering.html) by **DataTalks.Club**.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each homework assignment. Each folder includes the solutions for the respective tasks, along with a dedicated README explaining the approach.
