### **Prepare Postgres**  
I set up a PostgreSQL instance and loaded the required datasets using the steps provided in the course.  

1. Downloaded the datasets:  
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-10.csv.gz
   wget https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/misc/taxi_zone_lookup.csv
   ```
2. Loaded the data into PostgreSQL using a Python script `pipe.py` for automation.

**Answer: [question4.sql](./question4.sql)**  
- Longest trip occurred on: `2019-10-31`

---

### **Question 5: Three Biggest Pickup Zones**  
Identify the top 3 pickup locations with total amounts exceeding 13,000 on `2019-10-18`.

### **Terraform Tasks**  

I used Terraform to set up infrastructure on Google Cloud Platform (GCP):  

1. Installed Terraform on my environment.  
2. Cloned and customized the course files from the [Terraform section](#).  
3. Created a GCP Bucket and a BigQuery dataset as required.  

---

### **Question 7: Terraform Workflow**  
Select the correct sequence for the Terraform workflow:  
1. Download provider plugins and set up the backend.  
2. Generate proposed changes and auto-execute the plan.  
3. Remove all resources managed by Terraform.  

**Answer:**  
`terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy`

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  

- **Docker** for containerization.  
- **PostgreSQL** for database setup and data analysis.  
- **Terraform** for infrastructure as code.
